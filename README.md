# survival-plot

This is a project that I have been working on using JavaScript with HTML5 Canvas to display survival plots for UALCAN, a resource that displays TCGA transcriptome data.

It is currently a work in progress, and I need to add some details to charts that are not currently displayed, such as p value.
