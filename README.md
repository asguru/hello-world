# survival-plot

This is a project that I have been working on using JavaScript with HTML5 Canvas to display survival plots for UALCAN, a resource that displays TCGA transcriptome data.

It is currently a work in progress, and I need to add some details to charts that are not currently displayed, such as p value.

I used an HTML Boilerplate template just to test out the JavaScript chart. This will be integrated into UALCAN eventually.

The code for the chart is in main.js in the js folder.
